\# Project Plan

**Author**: Adnan Salimi

## 1 Introduction

*The goal of this project is to design a Reminders application that allows users to log in and conveniently create and store reminders.


## 2 Process Description

**Activity 1**

- Login
- User logs into the application by entering their user account information. If the user does not currently have a profile, they can register one using their google account. Once the user has entered their credentials, they can click log in which will take them to the home page of the application.
- The entrance criteria required for the activity is the User's credentials for their profile. A valid username and password is required.
- The exit criteria for the activity is the User successfully logging into the application. Once the User successfully reaches the home page, the activity has been completed satisfactorily.


**Activity 2**

- Search/Create/Update/Delete Reminder
- User performs CRUD operations in a list of Reminders. When creating a Reminder, users will enter a name, type, subtype, and note for the Reminder. Once created, the Reminder displays the date of when it was created. The Reminder also has a checkbox which will control whether or not it is currently complete. The last attribute of the Reminder class is the ability for a user to attach an image, giving more specificity to the reminder.
- The entrance criteria for the activity is the User performing a CRUD operation after logging into the application. This operation will allow the User to achieve their desired action for creating Reminders. 
- The exit criteria for the activity is the User completing the desired CRUD operation. Once the Reminder has been successfully created or updated, the activity can be considered completed satisfactorily.
